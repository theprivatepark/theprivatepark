ðŸ‘‹ Hello World. My name is Anney and I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer in the DC Metropolitan Area. I'm open to relocating for the right opportunity.

ðŸŽ“  I received my Software Engineering education from Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development, Ruby on Rails & JavaScript program.

ðŸ’»  I am currently studying algorithms using courses on Udemy, Leetcode, Codewars & other online resources. 

âœ¨  Iâ€™m currently looking to work in an environment where growth is strongly encouraged & where my curiosity is welcomed in the team.
